Approach used
 1. Data Understanding and Preparation
Dataset Structure: I reviewed the columns, record count (11,000), and encoding (latin-1) to ensure correct interpretation.

Key Fields Identified:

For segmentation: Order Mode, Product Name, Sales, Profit Margin, etc.

For aggregation: Sales, Orders, Quantity, Profit, etc.

ðŸ“Š 2. Descriptive Analysis
A. Order Mode Analysis
Grouped by Order Mode:

Aggregated total sales, average sales per order, order count, and calculated profit margin.

Calculated the percentage share of each mode (In-Store vs. Online).

Visual Output: A pie chart was generated to clearly communicate the market share split.

B. Product Performance Analysis
Revenue Ranking:

Sorted all products by total revenue to identify top and bottom performers.

Calculated average revenue per order and total quantity sold for each.

Selected top 5 and bottom 5 for clear contrast.

Key Metrics Computed:

Revenue contribution %

Profit margin %

Revenue gap between top and bottom products

Visual Outputs:

Bar Chart: For Top 5 product revenue contributions.

Scatter Plot: To illustrate the relationship between product revenue and profit margin.

ðŸ“ˆ 3. Insight Extraction
Focused on high-level takeaways:

Balanced channel performance (Online slightly ahead in sales and margin).

Concentration risk (Top 5 products make up only 6.6% of total sales).

Low-revenue products have surprisingly high margins, suggesting a different optimization strategy.

ðŸ§  4. Visualization and Reporting
Used clear, minimalistic charts:

Pie chart for categorical comparison (order mode).

Bar chart for ranked numeric comparison (revenue).

Scatter plot to show relationship patterns (revenue vs. margin).

Structured the narrative into:

Executive summary

Segment-level insights

Product-level insights

Visual evidence

Actionable recommendations
